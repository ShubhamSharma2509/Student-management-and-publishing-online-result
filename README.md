**Tutorial Management System** is a Python project that operates as a GUI-based application. 

This project provides us with a simple interface for the maintenance of student information. It can be used by educational institutes or colleges to maintain the records of students easily. Achieving this objective is difficult using a manual system as the information is scattered, can be redundant, and collecting relevant information may be very time-consuming. All these problems are solved using this project.

Throughout the project, the focus has been on presenting information in an easy and intelligible manner. The project is very useful for those who want to know about Student Information Management Systems and want to develop software/websites based on the same concept.
 
The project provides facilities like online registration and profile creation of students thus reducing paperwork and automating the record generation process in an educational institution. 			

The objective of the Student Information System is to allow the administrator of any organization to edit and find out the personal details of a student and allows the student to keep up to date with his profile. It’ll also facilitate keeping all the records of students, such as their id, name, mailing address, phone number, DOB, etc. So all the information about a student will be available in a few seconds. 

Overall, it’ll make Student Information Management an easier job for the administrator and the student of any organization. 

The main purpose of this SRS document is to illustrate the requirements of the project Student Information System and is intended to help any organization to maintain and manage its student’s personal data



**Its primary functionalities include:**

**1.Student Admission Management:** Allows the user to admit students into the tutorial system.

**2.Batch Management:** Facilitates the management of batches, which likely includes creating, modifying, and deleting batches of students.

**3.Teacher Management:** Provides tools to manage teachers, such as adding new teachers, assigning them to batches, or updating their information.

**4.Result Publication:** Automates the process of publishing students' results. This involves displaying grades or scores in the GUI interface.

**5.Database Integration:** Stores all relevant data, such as student information, batch details, teacher records, and student results, in a database. This ensures that the information is securely stored and easily retrievable.

Overall, the system aims to streamline administrative tasks related to student management, batch handling, teacher oversight, and result distribution through a user-friendly graphical interface, all implemented using Python programming language.
